# Background Functions Implementation

## Overview

This document explains how we implemented Netlify Background Functions to handle long-running data synchronization operations that exceed the standard 10-second timeout limit.

## Problem

The TaskDetail copy operation was failing with a 504 Gateway Timeout error because:
- The operation involves copying thousands of records from the data lake to MongoDB
- This process takes longer than Netlify's 10-second function execution limit
- When the limit was exceeded, Netlify terminated the function and returned a 504 error

## Solution

We implemented the following changes:

1. **Converted copy-taskdetail.js to a Background Function**
   - Added the background function configuration:
   ```javascript
   export const config = {
     background: true
   };
   ```
   - This allows the function to run for up to 15 minutes instead of 10 seconds

2. **Created a simple-status.js endpoint**
   - This endpoint provides status updates for background jobs
   - Returns information about job progress, records processed, etc.

3. **Updated the frontend DataCopy.js component**
   - Modified to handle 504 responses correctly (these are expected for background functions)
   - Added polling logic to check job status periodically
   - Improved error handling for background processes

## How It Works

1. When the user clicks "Copy TaskDetail Data":
   - The frontend calls the copy-taskdetail function
   - The function starts processing in the background
   - Netlify returns a 504 response (this is normal for background functions)

2. The frontend:
   - Recognizes the 504 as an expected response
   - Generates a client-side job ID
   - Starts polling the simple-status endpoint for updates
   - Displays progress information to the user

3. The background function:
   - Continues processing data in the background
   - Can run for up to 15 minutes
   - Processes data in batches to optimize performance

## Testing

To test this implementation:
1. Click the "Copy TaskDetail Data" button
2. Observe that the UI shows "Copy started as background process"
3. Wait for status updates to appear
4. Verify that the process completes successfully
