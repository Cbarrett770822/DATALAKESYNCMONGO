# Netlify Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes we've implemented to resolve deployment issues with the WMS DataLake Sync application on Netlify.

## 1. Logo Files Issue

**Problem**: The build was generating warnings about missing logo files referenced in the manifest.json file.

**Solution**:
- Added placeholder logo files (logo192.png, logo512.png, favicon.ico)
- Created scripts to generate these files:
  - `create-placeholder-logos.js`: A Node.js script that creates minimal valid PNG files
  - `build.sh`: A shell script that runs the logo generation before building

## 2. API Function Import Names

**Problem**: The ApiTester component was importing functions with names that didn't match the exported functions in api.js.

**Solution**:
- Updated the import statement in ApiTester.js to use the correct function names:
  ```javascript
  import { submitQuery, checkQueryStatus as checkStatus, getQueryResults as getResults } from '../utils/api';
  ```

## 3. Build Process

**Problem**: The build process wasn't properly handling the logo files and other prerequisites.

**Solution**:
- Added a `prebuild` script in package.json to run the logo generation script
- Created a `build.sh` script that ensures the logo files are created before building
- Updated netlify.toml to use the build.sh script:
  ```toml
  [build]
    command = "chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh"
    publish = "build"
    functions = "functions"
  ```

## 4. Netlify Functions

**Problem**: There was no clear entry point for the Netlify Functions API.

**Solution**:
- Added an index.js file in the functions directory that:
  - Lists all available functions
  - Provides proper CORS headers
  - Serves as documentation for the API

## 5. API Testing

**Problem**: There was no easy way to test the DataFabric API integration.

**Solution**:
- Created an ApiTester component that:
  - Allows submitting SQL queries directly to the DataFabric API
  - Shows the complete flow of the API process
  - Provides detailed feedback at each step
  - Shows raw API responses for debugging
- Added a route for the API Tester at `/api-tester`
- Added a navigation item for easy access

## 6. Simplified Functions

**Problem**: The sync-taskdetail function was failing with 500 errors.

**Solution**:
- Created a simplified version (sync-taskdetail-simple.js) that:
  - Accepts the same inputs as the real function
  - Returns mock data without actually connecting to databases
  - Helps isolate whether issues are in the frontend or backend
- Updated the API utility to try the simplified endpoint first, then fall back to the original

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Netlify Builds**:
   - Check the Netlify build logs for any remaining issues
   - Verify that the logo files are being generated correctly

2. **Test API Integration**:
   - Use the API Tester to verify that the DataFabric API integration is working
   - Check each step of the process (query submission, job status, results retrieval)

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set up the required environment variables in Netlify for:
     - MongoDB connection string
     - ION API credentials
     - Other configuration options

4. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Test the sync functionality with real data
   - Verify that data is being properly synchronized to MongoDB

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitor the performance of the application
   - Optimize API calls and database operations as needed
