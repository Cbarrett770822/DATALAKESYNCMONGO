# Deployment Fixes for Netlify

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Netlify deployment issues for the WMS DataLake Sync Web Application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing @mui/x-date-pickers Dependency

**Issue**: The build was failing because the `@mui/x-date-pickers` package was missing from the dependencies.

**Fix**: Added the `@mui/x-date-pickers` package to the `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@mui/x-date-pickers": "^6.10.0"
}
```

### 2. Deprecated DatePicker API

**Issue**: The DatePicker component was using the deprecated `renderInput` prop.

**Fix**: Updated the DatePicker components to use the newer `slotProps` API:

```jsx
// Before
<DatePicker
  label="Start Date"
  value={formState.startDate}
  onChange={handleDateChange('startDate')}
  renderInput={(params) => <TextField {...params} fullWidth />}
/>

// After
<DatePicker
  label="Start Date"
  value={formState.startDate}
  onChange={handleDateChange('startDate')}
  slotProps={{ textField: { fullWidth: true } }}
/>
```

### 3. ION API Credentials Loading

**Issue**: The ION API utility was trying to read credentials from a file, which might cause issues in the Netlify serverless environment.

**Fix**: Modified the `loadCredentials` function to use environment variables:

```javascript
function loadCredentials() {
  try {
    // Check if credentials are available as environment variables
    if (process.env.ION_TENANT && 
        process.env.ION_SAAK && 
        process.env.ION_SASK && 
        process.env.ION_CLIENT_ID && 
        process.env.ION_CLIENT_SECRET && 
        process.env.ION_API_URL && 
        process.env.ION_SSO_URL) {
      
      console.log('Using ION API credentials from environment variables');
      return {
        tenant: process.env.ION_TENANT,
        saak: process.env.ION_SAAK,
        sask: process.env.ION_SASK,
        clientId: process.env.ION_CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.ION_CLIENT_SECRET,
        ionApiUrl: process.env.ION_API_URL,
        ssoUrl: process.env.ION_SSO_URL
      };
    }
    
    // Fall back to reading from file
    // ... (existing file reading code)
  } catch (error) {
    // ... (error handling)
  }
}
```

### 4. Environment Variables Documentation

**Issue**: There was no documentation on how to set up environment variables in Netlify.

**Fix**: Created a comprehensive guide (`NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP.md`) for setting up environment variables in Netlify, including:

- Required environment variables for MongoDB connection
- Required environment variables for ION API credentials
- Step-by-step instructions for setting up environment variables in Netlify
- Instructions for using environment variables in development
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting tips

### 5. README Updates

**Issue**: The README did not include information about environment variables setup.

**Fix**: Updated the README to include information about environment variables setup and added links to the `NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP.md` guide.

## Next Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables in Netlify**:
   - Follow the instructions in `NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP.md` to set up the required environment variables in Netlify.

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Verify that the application is deployed successfully to Netlify.
   - Test the application to ensure it can connect to MongoDB Atlas and the Infor DataFabric API.

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Monitor the Netlify function logs for any errors or issues.
   - Address any issues that arise during deployment or runtime.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider implementing caching strategies for API responses.
   - Optimize MongoDB queries for better performance.
   - Implement pagination for large datasets.

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement authentication and authorization.
   - Secure sensitive data and credentials.
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints.
