# Real API Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to remove all mock data and simplified functions from the application, ensuring that only real API endpoints are used.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Simplified API Functions

The following simplified function files were removed:
- `functions/submit-query-simple.js`
- `functions/check-status-simple.js`
- `functions/get-results-simple.js`
- `functions/sync-taskdetail-simple.js`
- `functions/utils/api-handler.js`

These files contained mock implementations that returned fake data instead of making real API calls.

### 2. Updated API Utility

The `src/utils/api.js` file was updated to:
- Remove all references to simplified endpoints
- Use only real API endpoints
- Remove fallback mechanisms that were masking real errors
- Ensure proper error handling for all API calls

### 3. Updated Functions Index

The `functions/index.js` file was updated to:
- Remove references to simplified functions in the API documentation
- List only the real API endpoints that are available

### 4. Updated Environment Configuration

The environment configuration files were updated to:
- Remove the `USE_REAL_API` flag that was controlling whether to use real or mock APIs
- Update documentation to reflect that only real API endpoints are used

## Benefits of Using Real APIs

1. **Accurate Error Reporting**: When an API call fails, we now get the real error message instead of falling back to mock data, making debugging easier.

2. **Consistent Behavior**: The application now behaves consistently with the real backend, ensuring that what works in development will work in production.

3. **Better Testing**: Testing now validates the actual API integration, not just the UI with mock data.

4. **Simplified Codebase**: Removing the mock implementations and fallback mechanisms has simplified the codebase, making it easier to maintain.

## Next Steps

1. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for API failures, including user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms where appropriate.

2. **Logging**: Add detailed logging for API calls to help with debugging and monitoring.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize API calls to minimize latency and improve user experience.

4. **Authentication**: Ensure proper authentication is implemented for all API calls.

## Conclusion

By removing all mock data and simplified functions, we've created a more robust application that accurately reflects the behavior of the real API. This will make debugging easier and ensure that the application works correctly in production.
